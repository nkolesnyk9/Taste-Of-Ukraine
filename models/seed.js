    directions: "1st boil: To a large 8 qt pot add 2 pigs feet, 1 rear hock, 2 lbs pork loin, 2 lbs of boneless beef chuck, and add enough water to cover the meat. Bring to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes. Next, remove the meat to a clean bowl. Discard the cooking liquid and wash the pot clean.2nd boil: Add all the meat back to the pot, cover with fresh water and bring to a boil. Then, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 hours. All throughout cooking constantly skim the top from impurities with a slotted spoon. Do not cover with a lid.Tip: Preventing rapid boil and keeping the lid off while simmering will ensure that the broth comes out clear and not cloudy.Keep an eye on the water level and add more if needed to keep the meat submerged at all times. If needed add a smaller sized lid or dinner plate to the top of the meat to weigh the meat down and under the water. Add aromatics: Now add 2 onions, 2 carrots, 3 stalks celery, 15 black peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, and 1 Tbsp of salt to the stock. Continue simmering for 1 more hour. Remove solids: Remove all meat chunks from the broth to a large bowl and leave to cool to room temp.Remove and discard the remaining vegetables (onions, carrots, and bay leaves).Lastly, add 6-8 cloves of minced garlic and 1 bunch of parsley to the broth and simmer for 2 minutes. Taste the broth and adjust the salt amount without disturbing the broth too much as not to break any remaining impurities.Once the meat has cooled, discard the pig's feet, any bones, fat, or skin.Shred the meat into bite-sized pieces and add to a 9x12 baking dish in an even layer. To make the meat aspic in individual portions, portion the meat between deep soup bowls or other small, but deep containers.Cover & refrigerate until ready for next step.While the meat is cooling drain and cool the broth: set a sieve lined with 2-3 layers of paper towels over a large pot. Carefully drain the broth to remove any solids, fat, or impurities. Change the paper towels as the broth stops flowing through the fat creates a barrier and prevents the liquid from going through. For best results, cool the broth to room temperature before using it in the next steps. Otherwise pouring hot broth over the meat will melt the fat in the meat and make it float to the top.Tip: The quickest way to cool the broth is to set the pot with the hot broth into a sink full of cold/icy water and stir it every so often until the broth cools....NOT FINISHED!",
